# Leetcode

Just a wrapper repository for some of the Leetcode challeges I completed. I'm not a competitive programmer, I just like to solve problems and learn new things.

## Disclaimer

- Vast majority of them include bad habits like *"using namespace std"*; I know they're bad but they are part of the enviroment given by Leetcode.

- Only the code written by myself will be in this repository (= not by Leetcode environment). For more info regarding the problem, every single file is named exactly like the challenge on Leetcode and easily foundable.

- No official test will be submitted, due to potential plagiarism problems.
